# 👋 Welcome to SearchMe!
__SearchMe is a Python-based web application that allows users to search for relevant information by querying a dataset of web pages.__\
With SearchMe, you can easily find relevant web pages based on your search query and explore the contents of those pages.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with SearchMe, you need to install the required Python packages using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed the required packages, you can start the web application by running the following command:
```
py API.py
```
__The web application will be available at http://localhost:5000/.__

## 📖 How it works
__SearchMe uses a combination of natural language processing techniques and ranking algorithms 
to retrieve relevant web pages based on user queries.__
When you provide a search query, SearchMe fetches a dataset of web pages and filters the pages based on their relevance to the query.
The system then ranks the pages based on their relevance and displays the top results to the user.
