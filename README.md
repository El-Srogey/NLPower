# 🗣️💻🔍 NLP Projects Showcase 📚🚀
__Welcome to my NLP projects repository, where I showcase my natural language processing skills through three exciting projects:__

## 1️⃣ Article Recommendation System
In this project, I scraped data from online news articles and used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to build a recommendation system. I also utilized Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap to create a web application for users to interact with the model.

## 2️⃣ Search Engine for Better Ranking
I developed a search engine that uses Google Programmable Search Engine to rank search results based on a custom scoring algorithm. This project involved web scraping, data cleaning, and building a ranking model using natural language processing techniques.

## 3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis Project
In this project, I performed sentiment analysis on movie reviews to predict the sentiment of future reviews. I used Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and scikit-learn to build the model and achieve high accuracy.

__Feel free to check out each project's repository for a detailed description and code implementation. ^_^__
